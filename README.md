# Sorting Algorithm Comparer
___
### Lets compare some sorting algorithms, shall we ?

[![N|Solid](https://www.python.org/static/img/psf-logo@2x.png)](https://www.python.org/)

A simple, python GUI based program, to compare some of the highly common sorting algorithms, on how much time they take to sort a given data
___
## Features :

- GUI Based
- Shows results with time taken by algorithms as well as sorted array result
- Includes a classic boot screen (surprise)
- A LoFi background music to chill while analysing
- 10 Sorting algorithms included
- Scrollbars, button as well as nice table to for comparison
- Exit Button :)
- Seperate Modules for sorting algos as well as booting screen. You can use it anywhere if needed.
- An unsed file - "loading_screen_with_cars.py" -  which makes a loading up animation type with only keyboard characters.
- A small About-Me kind of page for small informatiion. Do read to know more and support :)
___
## Algorithms Included :
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Cocktail Sort
- Heap Sort
- PigeonHole Sort
- Gnome Sort
- Shell Sort
- Odd-Even Sort
- Cycle Sort
___
## Libraries and Softwares Used :
- Python 3.9x (backwards compatible)
- VSCode for editing
- Python Libraries :
 -- Numpy
-- Tkinter
-- Custom Tkinter [https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter]
-- Playsound && Winsound
-- Image && ImageTK
___
## Getting Started 

### Prerequisites
Here is how to install some of the important things before running the code

* Numpy
```
python3 -m pip install numpy
```

- Tkinter
```
python3 -m pip install tkinter
```

- Custom Tkinter
```
python3 -m pip install customtkinter
```

- Playsound
```
python3 -m pip install playsound
```
### Installtion
1. Clone the repo by using this command :
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Gurneet1928/sorting_algorithm_comparer.git
```
2. Run the **main.py** from the folder and you should be good to go üëç

___
## Usage
#### For Data :
1. Enter any kind of numerical data in the **Text Box** of **Main Menu**.
2. Click on **Submit Button**
3. Check the results of time taken by each algorithm on the bottom on the window
4. Check the sorted array on the bottom of window

#### For Music :
1. Click on the **MUTE BUTTON** on the top right corner to mute the background music
2. Click again to **UNMUTE BUTTON** the background music
3. The button changes its face so as to display the current status.

___
## Possible future Updates/Improvements/Ideas/Etc. :
1. Support for more algorithms
2. Better GUI designs and adaptability
3. More information about algorithms 
4. More music control options
5. Change GUI theme options 
6. Option to add user-defined algorithms for comparison purpose
Maybe some more that I can't define here, although these are only currently in thought process and no clear roadmap to implement them
